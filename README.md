## About this Repo <a name="About"></a>

This repo is a collection of resources which are supplemental to Amazon Security Lake. Amazon Security Lake automatically centralizes security data from cloud, on-premises, and custom sources into a purpose-built data lake stored in your account. With Security Lake, you can get a more complete understanding of your security data across your entire organization. You can also improve the protection of your workloads, applications, and data. Security Lake has adopted the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF), an open standard. With OCSF support, the service can normalize and combine security data from AWS and a broad range of enterprise security data sources. 

The resources currently available within this repo are as follows:

1. OCSF Parquet Data Validation
